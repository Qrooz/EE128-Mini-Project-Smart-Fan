# EE128-Mini-Project-Smart-Fan
For UCR EE128 embedded systems class, mini project consists of a "smart" cooling fan which automatically changes its speed according to temperature as well as turning off when it does not detect movement after a preset time. Code above shows the signals that the arduino sends to the K64F Freedom Board after detecting temperature shifts as well as movement signals using the passive infrared (PIR) Sensor.
